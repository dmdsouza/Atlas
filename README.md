## What it does
It is an Alexa skill that is a fun activity to do while also enhancing your geographical knowledge! How we play is Alexa gives you a country and you reply with another country starting with the last letter of the one Alexa gives. For example, I say Kenya. You could say Argentina because it starts with an A.
